You can download the NREL’s data for the solar spectrum (AM1.5G) and intensity (1000 W/m²) from [there](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/solar-resource/assets/data/astmg173.xls).

Btw [NumericalUnits](https://pypi.org/project/numericalunits/) is very convenient for numerical calculations, as it facilitates conversion between various units.
